# PortalBot
 A simple but effective, easily expandable bot to send messages between multiple channels in multiple different discord servers
 
 # Getting the bot to run

To get the bot to run, you have to do 2 things:
1) Make a file in lib/bot called token.0, and put the bots token in there
2) Change/set the channel ids in the list called `self.channels` in the `lib/cogs/portal.py` file


# Want to expand the bot?

It is easy to expand, just add more channel ids to the `self.channels` list in the `lib/cogs/portal.py` file

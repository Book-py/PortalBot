# PortalBot
 A simple but effective, easily expandable bot to send messages between 2 channels in 2 different discord servers
 
 # Getting the bot to run

To get the bot to run, you have to do 2 things:
1) Make a file in lib/bot called token.0, and put the bots token in there
2) Change the id's of the servers and channels


# Want to expand the bot?

It is easy to expand, just add more checks and send to more servers
